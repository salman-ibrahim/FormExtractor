# FormExtractor
This code is written to help the task of extracting face (Images) from forms submitted. Data Entry operators Struggle alot with this phase while working on form and it gets frustrating due to too much of time being consumed in this activity. This Code deals with the work of hours in the matter of seconds.

#How To Use it

Step 1: Upload All the forms to root directory i.e. same location as extract_face.py
Step 2: Open "extract_face.py" and execute it.
Step 3: Check the 2 directories:
  - One directory contains all the forms from which faces extracted succesfully
  - The Second Directory Contains all the Extracted Faces
  - All the forms that remain in the root directory are failed to be extracted an need manual extraction
 
#Additional Dependencies
